LogSearch is an opensource project maintained by the Cloud Operations team at City Index Ltd.  Based on the Elasticsearch ELK stack; and packaged as a BOSH release, it builds a log processing cluster tailored to making sense of your IT environment and the apps that run on it.

LogSearch can be used to analyse the logs of a Cloud Foundry cluster, as was demonstrated to the London PaaS Users Group on 08 April 2014.

Below is a screencast of that Logsearch for Cloud Foundry presentation ([youtube](http://youtu.be/OV4NwFQ0BA4))
