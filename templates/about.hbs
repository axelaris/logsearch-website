<!-- History -->

		<h1 id="history">History</h1>
	</div>
	<p class="lead">What started out as an internal development project from within <a href="http://www.cityindex.co.uk/" target="_blank">City Index</a> was soon after released as
        an open source project for all to benefit.</p>

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.cityindex.co.uk/" target="_blank">City Index</a> realised the potential value of the information available to them in the log files and required a flexible solution to not only view
        the log files but rather to view and cross analyse them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe something about event driven data ?
    </p>

    <p>
        Something about CI making it open source ?
