## Quick Start

We use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build the site - make sure you have it installed first. Next, you can clone and
this repo, run some setup scripts, and start Jekyll:

    $ git clone https://github.com/logsearch/logsearch-website.git
    $ cd logsearch-website
    $ ./_build/bin/reload-upstream
    $ jekyll serve -w

Now you should be able to point your browser to [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000/).
